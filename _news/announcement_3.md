I'm co-chairing [Crypto 2025](https://crypto.iacr.org/2025/) this year with [Yael Kalai](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/yael-kalai). If you need a visa to attend, *please make sure to start the process early this year* by reaching out the general chair [Francisco Rodríguez Henríquez](https://www.tii.ae/team/prof-francisco-rodriguez-henriquez) at crypto2025@iacr.org

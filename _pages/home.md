I am a Distinguished Scientist and Head of Research at
[MongoDB](https://mongodb.com). I also hold a Visiting Professor appointment in
the Department of [Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu) at [Brown
University](https://brown.edu). Before its acquisition by MongoDB, I was
co-founder and Chief Scientist at Aroki Systems and an Associate Professor at
Brown.  Prior to that, I was a Research Scientist at [Microsoft
Research](https://research.microsoft.com).

My research is in cryptography and is driven by real-world problems from
privacy, security and surveillance. I have worked extensively on the design and
cryptanalysis of encrypted search algorithms, which are efficient algorithms to
search on end-to-end encrypted data. I maintain interests in various aspects of
theory and systems, including applied and theoretical cryptography, data
structures and algorithms, databases, networking, game theory and technology
policy.

At Brown, I taught [Algorithms for the People](https://cs.brown.edu/~seny/2952v/), co-founded the [Center for Technological Responsibility,
Reimagination and Redesign](https://cntr.brown.edu/) (CNTR) with [Suresh
Venkatasubramanian](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/suresh), co-founded and
co-directed the [Encrypted Systems Lab](https://esl.cs.brown.edu) with [Tarik
Moataz](https://tarikmoataz.com/), co-founded the [Socially Responsible Computing](https://responsible.cs.brown.edu/) program with [Ugur Cetintemel](https://sites.google.com/a/brown.edu/ugur-cetintemel/), [Kathi Fisler](https://cs.brown.edu/~kfisler/) and [Julia Netter](https://www.julianetter.de/), and chaired the Diversity Committee and Mosaic+ Transition Program with Laura Dobler. I was also affiliated with the CAPS group, the
[Data Science Initiative](https://dsi.brown.edu), the [Center for Human Rights
and Humanitarian Studies](https://watson.brown.edu/chrhs/) and the [Policy
Lab](https://thepolicylab.brown.edu/).

Together with [Alishah Chator](https://alishahc.com/), [Leah Rosenbloom](https://namisa.art/) and [Lucy Qin](https://lucyq.in/), we founded the [Community-Driven Cryptography](https://communitydrivencrypto.github.io/) project and the [Re-Imagining Cryptography and Privacy](https://recapworkshop.online/) (ReCAP) Workshop. 

*Note: Unfortunately, I am not able to take on new PhD students.*

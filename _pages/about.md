I am a distinguished scientist and the head of research at
[MongoDB](https://mongodb.com). I also hold a visiting professor appointment in
the Department of [Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu) at [Brown
University](https://brown.edu). Before its acquisition by MongoDB, I was
co-founder and Chief Scientist at Aroki Systems and an associate professor at
Brown.  Prior to that, I was a research scientist at [Microsoft
Research](https://research.microsoft.com).

My research is in cryptography and is driven by real-world problems from
privacy, security and surveillance. I have worked extensively on the design and
cryptanalysis of encrypted search algorithms, which are efficient algorithms to
search on end-to-end encrypted data. I maintain interests in various aspects of
theory and systems, including applied and theoretical cryptography, data
structures and algorithms, databases, networking, game theory and technology
policy.

At Brown, I co-directed the [Encrypted Systems Lab](https://esl.cs.brown.edu)
and was affiliated with the CAPS group, the [Data Science
Initiative](https://dsi.brown.edu), the [Center for Human Rights and
Humanitarian Studies](https://watson.brown.edu/chrhs/) and the [Policy
Lab](https://thepolicylab.brown.edu/).

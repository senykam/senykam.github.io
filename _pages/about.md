I am a distinguished scientist and the head of research at MongoDB. I also hold
a visiting professor appointment in the Department of Computer Science at Brown
University. Before its acquisition by MongoDB, I was co-founder and Chief
Scientist at Aroki Systems and an associate professor at Brown.  Prior to that,
I was a research scientist at Microsoft Research.

My research is in cryptography and is driven by real-world problems from
privacy, security and surveillance. I have worked extensively on the design and
cryptanalysis of encrypted search algorithms, which are efficient algorithms to
search on end-to-end encrypted data. I maintain interests in various aspects of
theory and systems, including applied and theoretical cryptography, data
structures and algorithms, databases, networking, game theory and technology
policy.

At Brown, I co-directed the Encrypted Systems Lab and was affiliated with the
CAPS group, the Data Science Initiative, the Center for Human Rights and
Humanitarian Studies and the Policy Lab.


#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
